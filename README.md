### Dataset

We have used  a dummy dataset for this visualization. The dataset contains 10 stores and their monthly sales.

### Communication-minded Visualizations

Communication-minded visualizations are data visualizations designed with a primary focus on effectively conveying information, insights, and messages to a specific audience. The main goal of these visualizations is to facilitate clear and concise communication of complex data and analysis results to non-experts or decision-makers, enabling them to grasp the key takeaways easily.

#### Summarized Line Graphs

Summarized line graph visualization technique  is designed speciﬁcally for data analysts to communicate data to decision-makers more effectively and efﬁciently. The summarized line graph reduces a large and detailed dataset of multiple quantitative time-series into:

* representative data that provides a quick takeaway of the full dataset
* analytical highlights that distinguish speciﬁc insights of interest
* a data envelope that summarizes the remaining aggregated data
